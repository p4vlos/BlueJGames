Chapters 13-16 have been omitted from this folder to save space
as only chapters 1-12 are needed for CO881 and CO882.

All projects can be found on the CD supplied with the book or
downloaded from the book's web site - see "Resources" in:

  http://www.bluej.org/objects-first/

When copying/extracting additional projects from the CD/ZIP file
take care not to overwrite your existing folders for chapters 1-10
as they may contain your solutions to these exercises.
