PROJECT TITLE: BankAccount
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: A simple introduction to objects, classes and method invocation
VERSION or DATE: September 2003
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Create a new customer and a new vendor
AUTHORS: Richard Jones
USER INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. Create a new Customer with your name. Inspect the new customer object.
2. Get this customer to open an account with an initial £25.
3. Invoke the customer's getAccount method. In the dialogue box that appears, select the 
   "Object result=" line and click Get; click OK in the New Object Name dialogue. Inspect the bank 
   account object.
4. Credit this account with some money; debit the account. Experiment with different credits and 
   debits; can you make the account go overdrawn?
5. Create a new vendor, with some suitable name. Make the customer buy an item from this vendor 
   (tip: when the buy method call box appears, click the vendor object to fill in the argument). 
6. What happens to the customer's bank account? Keep buying items: what happens when the customer's 
   balance falls below the cost of an item (£10)?
